# Mobile Engineering Protocol (MEP)

> **Purpose**: Provide a comprehensive, phased approach for an AI mobile engineer to build high-quality, cross-platform mobile applications. This protocol emphasizes native performance, consistent user experience, and efficient development across iOS and Android platforms.
>
> This protocol incorporates best practices from Airbnb Mobile, Uber Engineering, Instagram Mobile Performance, and React Native/Flutter communities.

## 🔄 High-Level MEP Cycle

1. **Plan → Develop → Optimize → Test → Deploy**
2. Each phase ends with a *Platform Gate* requiring explicit **Yes** before advancing
3. Outputs are mobile apps, platform-specific builds, and store-ready packages

## 📑 Phase Instructions

### Phase 1: Mobile Architecture & Platform Strategy

**Objective**: Design mobile architecture and choose development approach.

| Step | Key Activities | Sub-Checkpoint |
| ---- | -------------- | -------------- |
| 1. Requirements Analysis | Analyze features, performance needs, and target devices | Requirements mapped |
| 2. Platform Strategy | Native vs React Native vs Flutter decision | Framework selected |
| 3. Architecture Design | Component structure, state management, navigation | Architecture documented |
| 4. Device Strategy | Target OS versions, screen sizes, and capabilities | Device matrix created |
| 5. Platform Gate | Review mobile strategy → **(Yes \| No \| Clarify)** | ✓ Move to Phase 2 |

> **Expected Output**: `phase1_mobile_strategy.md` with: Platform Decision, Architecture Diagrams, Device Support Matrix, Technology Stack, Development Timeline.

---

### Phase 2: Core Development & Native Integration

**Objective**: Build core functionality with platform-specific features.

1. **Project Setup** – Initialize mobile project with chosen framework
2. **Navigation Implementation** – Deep linking, tab/stack navigation
3. **Native Module Integration** – Camera, location, push notifications
4. **State Management** – Redux/MobX/Riverpod implementation
5. **Offline Capabilities** – Local storage and sync strategies
6. **Platform Gate** – Demo core features → confirm

> **Output**: `phase2_core_implementation.md` (Project Structure, Native Modules Used, State Architecture, Offline Strategy, Code Examples).

---

### Phase 3: UI/UX Optimization & Platform Compliance

**Objective**: Polish UI for native feel and platform guidelines.

| Platform Aspect | iOS Focus | Android Focus |
| -------------- | --------- | ------------- |
| **Design Language** | Human Interface Guidelines | Material Design |
| **Navigation** | UINavigationController patterns | Navigation component |
| **Animations** | Core Animation, SwiftUI | Motion Layout, Jetpack |
| **Gestures** | iOS-specific gestures | Android gesture navigation |

**Flow**:
1. Implement platform-specific UI components
2. Add native animations and transitions
3. Optimize gesture handling
4. Implement platform themes
5. Accessibility compliance
6. Platform Gate with UI review

> **Output**: `phase3_ui_optimization.md` (UI Component Library, Animation Catalog, Gesture Implementation, Accessibility Report, Platform Compliance).

---

### Phase 4: Performance & Device Optimization

**Objective**: Optimize for performance across device spectrum.

1. **Memory Optimization** – Profile and fix memory leaks
2. **Battery Optimization** – Minimize background activity
3. **Network Optimization** – Efficient data usage, caching
4. **App Size Reduction** – Code splitting, asset optimization
5. **Performance Monitoring** – Crash reporting, ANR detection
6. **Platform Gate** – Verify performance targets met

> **Output**: `phase4_performance_report.md` (Memory Profile, Battery Impact, Network Usage, App Size Analysis, Performance Metrics).

---

### Phase 5: Testing & Store Deployment

**Objective**: Comprehensive testing and app store submission.

1. **Device Testing** – Test on real devices across OS versions
2. **Automated Testing** – Unit, integration, and UI tests
3. **Beta Testing** – TestFlight/Play Console beta distribution
4. **Store Optimization** – ASO, screenshots, descriptions
5. **Submission Preparation** – Certificates, provisioning, compliance
6. **Release Management** – Phased rollout strategy
7. **Final Platform Gate** – Store submission approval

> **Output**: `phase5_deployment_package.md` (Test Report, Store Listing, Release Notes, Submission Checklist, Rollout Plan).

## 📝 Universal Prompts & Patterns

- **Think Native**: "How would a native developer implement this?"
- **Respect the Platform**: "Does this follow platform conventions?"
- **Optimize Resources**: "What's the impact on battery and memory?"
- **Plan for Offline**: "How does this work without connectivity?"

---

## 🛑 Guardrails (What NOT to Do)

1. **Never ignore platform guidelines** – Rejection risk
2. **Don't drain battery** – Users will uninstall
3. **Avoid web-like UI** – Must feel native
4. **Never ship untested** – Mobile bugs are hard to fix

# Performance Engineering Protocol (PEP)

> **Purpose**: Provide a systematic, phased approach for an AI performance engineer to optimize system performance, identify bottlenecks, and ensure applications meet demanding performance requirements. This protocol emphasizes measurement, analysis, and cost-effective optimization.
>
> This protocol incorporates best practices from Google Web Vitals, Netflix Performance Team, Amazon Performance Engineering, and high-frequency trading systems.

## 🔄 High-Level PEP Cycle

1. **Baseline → Profile → Analyze → Optimize → Validate**
2. Each phase ends with a *Performance Gate* requiring explicit **Yes** before advancing
3. Outputs are performance reports, optimization plans, and monitoring dashboards

## 📑 Phase Instructions

### Phase 1: Performance Baseline & Requirements

**Objective**: Establish current performance metrics and target goals.

| Step | Key Activities | Sub-Checkpoint |
| ---- | -------------- | -------------- |
| 1. Requirements Gathering | Define SLAs, user expectations, and business KPIs | Targets documented |
| 2. Baseline Measurement | Measure current performance across all tiers | Baseline recorded |
| 3. User Journey Analysis | Identify critical paths and user scenarios | Journey maps created |
| 4. Infrastructure Assessment | Review current architecture and resources | Capacity documented |
| 5. Performance Gate | Review baseline vs targets → **(Yes \| No \| Clarify)** | ✓ Move to Phase 2 |

> **Expected Output**: `phase1_performance_baseline.md` with: Current Metrics, Target SLAs, Critical Paths, Infrastructure Inventory, Gap Analysis.

### Phase 2: Performance Profiling & Bottleneck Discovery

**Objective**: Deep dive into system behavior to identify bottlenecks.

1. **Application Profiling** – CPU, memory, and I/O analysis
2. **Database Profiling** – Query performance and index usage
3. **Network Analysis** – Latency, bandwidth, and protocol efficiency
4. **Frontend Profiling** – Render performance and asset loading
5. **Distributed Tracing** – End-to-end request flow analysis
6. **Performance Gate** – Confirm bottlenecks identified → proceed

### Phase 3: Optimization Strategy & Implementation

**Objective**: Implement targeted optimizations based on impact and effort.

| Optimization Area | Techniques | Expected Gain |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| **Algorithm** | Big-O improvements, caching | 10-100x |
| **Database** | Indexing, query optimization | 5-50x |
| **Caching** | Redis, CDN, browser cache | 10-100x |
| **Frontend** | Bundle splitting, lazy loading | 2-5x |
| **Infrastructure** | Scaling, resource tuning | 2-10x |

**Flow**:
1. Prioritize optimizations by ROI
2. Implement algorithmic improvements
3. Optimize database operations
4. Add strategic caching layers
5. Tune infrastructure resources
6. Performance Gate with measurements

> **Output**: `phase3_optimization_log.md` (Implementation Details, Before/After Metrics, Code Changes, Configuration Updates).

---

### Phase 4: Load Testing & Capacity Planning

**Objective**: Validate performance under load and plan for scale.

1. **Load Test Design** – Realistic traffic patterns and scenarios
2. **Stress Testing** – Find breaking points and degradation curves
3. **Capacity Modeling** – Project resource needs for growth
4. **Auto-scaling Setup** – Configure dynamic scaling policies
5. **Cost Optimization** – Balance performance with cloud costs
6. **Performance Gate** – Verify scalability requirements met

> **Output**: `phase4_load_test_report.md` (Test Results, Capacity Model, Scaling Policies, Cost Analysis, Growth Projections).

---

### Phase 5: Monitoring & Continuous Optimization

**Objective**: Establish ongoing performance monitoring and optimization.

1. **Monitoring Setup** – Real user monitoring (RUM) and synthetics
2. **Alert Configuration** – SLI/SLO-based performance alerts
3. **Dashboard Creation** – Executive and engineering views
4. **Performance Budget** – Enforce limits in CI/CD
5. **Optimization Playbook** – Document common issues and fixes
6. **Final Performance Gate** – Production performance verified

> **Output**: `phase5_performance_operations.md` (Monitoring Setup, Alert Rules, Dashboard Links, Performance Budgets, Optimization Playbook).

## 📝 Universal Prompts & Patterns

- **Measure First**: "What's the baseline before we optimize?"
- **Find the 80/20**: "Which optimization gives the biggest bang for buck?"
- **Think End-to-End**: "Where's the bottleneck in the entire flow?"
- **Consider the User**: "What performance improvement would users actually notice?"

## 🛑 Guardrails (What NOT to Do)

1. **Never optimize without measuring** – Premature optimization is evil
2. **Don't ignore cost** – Performance at any price isn't sustainable
3. **Avoid micro-optimizations** – Focus on significant improvements
4. **Never sacrifice correctness** – Fast but wrong is useless

# Security Engineering Protocol (SEP)

> **Purpose**: Provide a comprehensive, phased approach for an AI security engineer to build secure systems through threat modeling, vulnerability assessment, and defense-in-depth strategies. This protocol emphasizes proactive security, automated scanning, and continuous compliance.
>
> This protocol incorporates best practices from OWASP, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, Zero Trust Architecture, and DevSecOps principles.

## 🔄 High-Level SEP Cycle

1. **Model → Assess → Harden → Monitor → Respond**
2. Each phase ends with a *Security Gate* requiring explicit **Yes** before advancing
3. Outputs are threat models, security reports, hardening guides, and incident playbooks

## 📑 Phase Instructions

### Phase 1: Threat Modeling & Risk Assessment

**Objective**: Identify threats and vulnerabilities through systematic analysis.

| Step | Key Activities | Sub-Checkpoint |
| ---- | -------------- | -------------- |
| 1. Asset Identification | Catalog data, systems, and critical assets | Asset inventory complete |
| 2. Threat Modeling | Use STRIDE/PASTA to identify threats | Threat model documented |
| 3. Attack Surface Analysis | Map entry points and trust boundaries | Attack surface mapped |
| 4. Risk Scoring | Calculate likelihood × impact for each threat | Risk matrix created |
| 5. Security Gate | Review threat landscape → **(Yes \| No \| Clarify)** | ✓ Move to Phase 2 |

> **Expected Output**: `phase1_threat_model.md` with: Asset Inventory, Threat Catalog, Attack Surface Map, Risk Matrix, Mitigation Priority.

---

### Phase 2: Security Architecture & Controls

**Objective**: Design security controls to mitigate identified risks.

1. **Authentication Design** – MFA, SSO, passwordless options
2. **Authorization Framework** – RBAC/ABAC implementation
3. **Data Protection** – Encryption at rest and in transit
4. **Network Security** – Segmentation, firewall rules, zero trust
5. **Application Security** – Input validation, output encoding, CSP
6. **Security Gate** – Validate control effectiveness → confirm

> **Output**: `phase2_security_architecture.md` (Control Matrix, Implementation Guides, Security Patterns, Configuration Standards).

---

### Phase 3: Security Implementation & Hardening

**Objective**: Implement security controls and harden systems.

| Security Layer | Implementation Focus | Validation |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ---------- |
| **Code Security** | Secure coding practices, SAST integration | No critical findings |
| **Dependencies** | Vulnerability scanning, license compliance | All CVEs patched |
| **Infrastructure** | CIS benchmarks, least privilege | Compliance score >90% |
| **Secrets Management** | Vault integration, rotation policies | No hardcoded secrets |

**Flow**:
1. Implement secure coding guidelines
2. Configure SAST/DAST in CI/CD
3. Harden infrastructure configurations
4. Set up secrets management
5. Enable security logging
6. Security Gate with scan results

> **Output**: `phase3_security_implementation.md` (Hardening Checklist, Scan Results, Compliance Report, Security Configurations).

---

### Phase 4: Security Testing & Validation

**Objective**: Validate security controls through comprehensive testing.

1. **Vulnerability Assessment** – Automated scanning of all components
2. **Penetration Testing** – Simulated attacks on critical paths
3. **Security Code Review** – Manual review of sensitive code
4. **Compliance Validation** – Check against standards (PCI, HIPAA, etc.)
5. **Red Team Exercise** – Full system security validation
6. **Security Gate** – All critical issues resolved

> **Output**: `phase4_security_validation.md` (Vulnerability Report, Pentest Results, Remediation Log, Compliance Status, Security Metrics).

---

### Phase 5: Security Operations & Incident Response

**Objective**: Establish ongoing security monitoring and incident response.

1. **SIEM Configuration** – Log correlation and threat detection
2. **Incident Response Plan** – Playbooks for common scenarios
3. **Security Monitoring** – Real-time threat detection rules
4. **Automated Response** – Automated remediation workflows
5. **Security Training** – Team security awareness program
6. **Final Security Gate** – Operational readiness confirmed

> **Output**: `phase5_security_operations.md` (IR Playbooks, Monitoring Rules, Training Materials, Security Metrics Dashboard, Maintenance Plan).

## 📝 Universal Prompts & Patterns

- **Assume Breach**: "What happens after an attacker gets in?"
- **Least Privilege**: "What's the minimum access needed?"
- **Defense in Depth**: "What if this control fails?"
- **Security by Design**: "How do we make the secure path the easy path?"

---

## 🛑 Guardrails (What NOT to Do)

1. **Never store secrets in code** – Use proper secret management
2. **Don't rely on obscurity** – Assume attackers know your system
3. **Avoid security theater** – Focus on real risk reduction
4. **Never skip security updates** – Patch promptly and consistently

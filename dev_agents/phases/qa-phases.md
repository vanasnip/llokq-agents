# Quality Assurance Protocol (QAP)

> **Purpose**: Provide a comprehensive, phased approach for an AI QA engineer to ensure software quality through systematic testing, bug prevention, and continuous improvement. This protocol emphasizes early defect detection, automated testing, and user-centric quality metrics.
>
> This protocol incorporates best practices from Google Testing Blog, Microsoft SDLC, Amazon's Testing Excellence, and modern DevOps testing strategies.

## 🔄 High-Level QAP Cycle

1. **Plan → Design → Execute → Analyze → Improve**
2. Each phase ends with a *Quality Gate* requiring explicit **Yes** before advancing
3. Outputs are test plans, automated suites, quality reports, and improvement recommendations

## 📑 Phase Instructions

### Phase 1: Test Strategy & Risk Analysis

**Objective**: Develop comprehensive test strategy based on risk assessment.

| Step | Key Activities | Sub-Checkpoint |
| ---- | -------------- | -------------- |
| 1. Requirements Analysis | Review functional and non-functional requirements | Test scope defined |
| 2. Risk Assessment | Identify high-risk areas and failure impacts | Risk matrix created |
| 3. Test Strategy Design | Define test levels, types, and approaches | Strategy documented |
| 4. Test Environment Planning | Specify required test environments and data | Environment plan ready |
| 5. Quality Gate | Present test strategy → **(Yes \| No \| Clarify)** | ✓ Move to Phase 2 |

> **Expected Output**: `phase1_test_strategy.md` with: Risk Matrix, Test Scope, Testing Levels, Environment Requirements, Success Criteria.

---

### Phase 2: Test Design & Case Development

**Objective**: Create comprehensive test cases covering all critical scenarios.

1. **Test Scenario Mapping** – Map user journeys to test scenarios
2. **Test Case Design** – Write detailed test cases with clear steps
3. **Test Data Preparation** – Create realistic test data sets
4. **Edge Case Identification** – Document boundary and negative tests
5. **Traceability Matrix** – Link tests to requirements
6. **Quality Gate** – Review test coverage → confirm

> **Output**: `phase2_test_design.md` (Test Scenarios, Test Cases, Test Data Requirements, Coverage Matrix, Edge Case Catalog).

---

### Phase 3: Test Automation & Execution

**Objective**: Implement automated tests and execute comprehensive test suites.

| Test Type | Automation Focus | Tools/Framework |
| --------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| **Unit Tests** | Business logic validation | Jest/Pytest |
| **Integration Tests** | API and service contracts | Postman/RestAssured |
| **UI Tests** | Critical user paths | Playwright/Cypress |
| **Performance Tests** | Load and stress scenarios | K6/JMeter |

**Flow**:
1. Set up test automation framework
2. Implement automated test suites
3. Configure CI/CD test integration
4. Execute manual exploratory tests
5. Run performance benchmarks
6. Quality Gate with execution report

> **Output**: `phase3_test_execution.md` (Automation Coverage, Test Results, Performance Baselines, Defect Log, CI/CD Configuration).

---

### Phase 4: Defect Analysis & Quality Metrics

**Objective**: Analyze test results and establish quality baselines.

1. **Defect Root Cause Analysis** – Categorize and analyze bug patterns
2. **Test Metrics Calculation** – Coverage, pass rate, defect density
3. **Quality Trend Analysis** – Track quality over time
4. **Test Effectiveness Review** – Evaluate test suite efficiency
5. **Process Improvement Ideas** – Identify testing gaps
6. **Quality Gate** – Verify quality standards met

> **Output**: `phase4_quality_analysis.md` (Defect Analysis Report, Quality Metrics Dashboard, Trend Charts, Improvement Recommendations).

---

### Phase 5: Release Validation & Continuous Monitoring

**Objective**: Ensure production readiness and establish ongoing quality monitoring.

1. **Release Testing** – Execute release candidate validation
2. **Regression Suite Finalization** – Update automated regression tests
3. **Production Monitoring Setup** – Configure quality alerts
4. **Documentation Update** – Test documentation and runbooks
5. **Knowledge Transfer** – Share testing insights with team
6. **Final Quality Gate** – Sign off on release quality

> **Output**: `phase5_release_package.md` (Release Test Report, Regression Suite, Monitoring Configuration, Test Documentation, Lessons Learned).

## 📝 Universal Prompts & Patterns

- **Think Like a User**: "What would frustrate a real user in this scenario?"
- **Break It**: "How can I make this fail in unexpected ways?"
- **Verify Assumptions**: "What are we assuming that needs validation?"
- **Consider Context**: "How does this behave under different conditions?"

## 🛑 Guardrails (What NOT to Do)

1. **Never test in production** – Use proper test environments
2. **Don't ignore flaky tests** – Fix or remove unreliable tests
3. **Avoid testing implementation** – Test behavior, not internals
4. **Never skip security testing** – Include security in every phase

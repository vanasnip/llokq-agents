# Backend Development Protocol (BDP)

> **Purpose**: Provide a structured, phased approach for an AI backend engineer to build robust, scalable, and maintainable server-side applications. This protocol emphasizes clean APIs, efficient data access, comprehensive testing, and production readiness.
>
> This protocol incorporates best practices from industry leaders including RESTful principles, SOLID design, Test-Driven Development, and cloud-native patterns.

## 🔄 High-Level BDP Cycle

1. **Design → Implement → Test → Optimize → Deploy**
2. Each phase ends with an *Validation Check* requiring explicit **Yes** before advancing
3. Outputs are working code, tests, API documentation, and deployment artifacts

## 📑 Phase Instructions

### Phase 1: API Design & Data Modeling

**Objective**: Design clean APIs and efficient data models based on requirements.

| Step | Key Activities | Sub-Checkpoint |
| ---- | -------------- | -------------- |
| 1. API Contract Design | Define endpoints, methods, request/response schemas | OpenAPI spec drafted |
| 2. Data Model Design | Create entity relationships, define schemas | ERD completed |
| 3. Error Handling Strategy | Define error codes, messages, and recovery | Error catalog created |
| 4. Security Design | Plan authentication, authorization, data protection | Security matrix defined |
| 5. Validation Check | Review API design and data models → **(Yes \| No \| Clarify)** | ✓ Move to Phase 2 |

> **Expected Output**: `phase1_api_design.md` with: OpenAPI Specification, Data Models, Error Handling Guide, Security Plan, Validation Status.

---

### Phase 2: Core Implementation

**Objective**: Implement business logic, data access, and core services.

1. **Project Setup** – Initialize project with chosen framework and dependencies
2. **Database Layer** – Implement models, migrations, and data access patterns
3. **Business Logic** – Code core domain logic with SOLID principles
4. **API Implementation** – Build endpoints matching the API specification
5. **Logging & Monitoring** – Add structured logging and metrics
6. **Validation Check** – Demonstrate working endpoints → confirm

> **Output**: `phase2_implementation.md` (Code Structure, Key Components, Database Schema, API Endpoints, Code Snippets).

---

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality Assurance

**Objective**: Ensure code quality through comprehensive testing.

| Test Type | Purpose | Coverage Target |
| --------- | ------- | --------------- |
| **Unit Tests** | Test individual functions/methods | >90% |
| **Integration Tests** | Test component interactions | Critical paths |
| **API Tests** | Validate endpoint behavior | All endpoints |
| **Performance Tests** | Verify response times | <100ms p95 |

**Flow**:
1. Write unit tests for business logic
2. Create integration tests for data layer
3. Build API test suite
4. Add performance benchmarks
5. Implement load tests
6. Validation Check with coverage report

> **Output**: `phase3_testing_report.md` (Test Inventory, Coverage Report, Performance Baselines, Test Execution Guide).

---

### Phase 4: Optimization & Hardening

**Objective**: Optimize performance and prepare for production.

1. **Performance Profiling** – Identify and fix bottlenecks
2. **Query Optimization** – Tune database queries, add indexes
3. **Caching Strategy** – Implement caching layers
4. **Rate Limiting** – Add API throttling
5. **Security Hardening** – Run security scans, fix vulnerabilities
6. **Validation Check** – Verify improvements

> **Output**: `phase4_optimization_report.md` (Performance Improvements, Security Scan Results, Caching Configuration, Rate Limit Rules).

---

### Phase 5: Deployment & Documentation

**Objective**: Prepare for production deployment with complete documentation.

1. **Containerization** – Create Docker images and compose files
2. **Configuration Management** – Externalize configs, manage secrets
3. **API Documentation** – Generate interactive API docs
4. **Deployment Scripts** – Create CI/CD pipeline configs
5. **Runbook Creation** – Document operations procedures
6. **Final Validation** – Production readiness checklist

> **Output**: `phase5_deployment_package.md` (Dockerfile, CI/CD Config, API Docs Link, Runbook, Deployment Checklist).

## 📝 Universal Prompts & Patterns

- **Validate Input**: "What validation rules apply to this data?"
- **Handle Errors**: "What should happen when this operation fails?"
- **Consider Scale**: "How will this perform with 1000x the data?"
- **Secure by Default**: "What security risks exist in this implementation?"

---

## 🛑 Guardrails (What NOT to Do)

1. **Never trust user input** – Always validate and sanitize
2. **Don't log sensitive data** – No passwords, tokens, or PII in logs
3. **Avoid N+1 queries** – Use eager loading and query optimization
4. **Never hardcode secrets** – Use environment variables or secret management

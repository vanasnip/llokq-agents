# Data Engineering Protocol (DEP)

> **Purpose**: Provide a systematic, phased approach for an AI data engineer to design and build scalable data architectures, efficient pipelines, and reliable analytics infrastructure. This protocol emphasizes data quality, performance optimization, and actionable insights.
>
> This protocol incorporates best practices from Netflix Data Platform, Uber's Data Infrastructure, Airbnb's Data University, and modern data mesh principles.

## 🔄 High-Level DEP Cycle

1. **Discover → Model → Build → Optimize → Govern**
2. Each phase ends with a *Quality Gate* requiring explicit **Yes** before advancing
3. Outputs are data models, ETL pipelines, quality reports, and analytics dashboards

## 📑 Phase Instructions

### Phase 1: Data Discovery & Requirements

**Objective**: Understand data sources, business needs, and quality requirements.

| Step | Key Activities | Sub-Checkpoint |
| ---- | -------------- | -------------- |
| 1. Source Analysis | Inventory data sources, formats, and volumes | Source catalog created |
| 2. Business Requirements | Define KPIs, metrics, and use cases | Requirements documented |
| 3. Data Profiling | Analyze data quality, patterns, and anomalies | Profile report complete |
| 4. Architecture Planning | Design high-level data flow and storage strategy | Architecture outlined |
| 5. Quality Gate | Review data landscape → **(Yes \| No \| Clarify)** | ✓ Move to Phase 2 |

> **Expected Output**: `phase1_data_discovery.md` with: Source Inventory, Data Dictionary, Quality Assessment, Architecture Vision, Success Metrics.

### Phase 2: Data Modeling & Schema Design

**Objective**: Design efficient, scalable data models for analytics.

1. **Conceptual Modeling** – Business entities and relationships
2. **Logical Design** – Normalized schemas and dimensions
3. **Physical Design** – Partitioning, indexing, and compression
4. **Data Warehouse Design** – Star/snowflake schemas, slowly changing dimensions
5. **Data Lineage Mapping** – Track data flow from source to insight
6. **Quality Gate** – Validate models with stakeholders → confirm

> **Output**: `phase2_data_models.md` (ERD Diagrams, Dimensional Models, Partitioning Strategy, Lineage Documentation, Schema DDL).

---

### Phase 3: Pipeline Development & Orchestration

**Objective**: Build reliable, efficient data pipelines.

| Pipeline Type | Technology Stack | Key Features |
| ------------ | --------------- | ------------ |
| **Ingestion** | Kafka/Kinesis, Debezium | Real-time CDC, batch loads |
| **Processing** | Spark, dbt, SQL | Transformations, aggregations |
| **Orchestration** | Airflow, Prefect | Scheduling, dependencies |
| **Quality** | Great Expectations | Validation, monitoring |

**Flow**:
1. Implement data ingestion pipelines
2. Build transformation logic (ELT/ETL)
3. Create data quality checks
4. Set up orchestration and scheduling
5. Implement error handling and retry logic
6. Quality Gate with pipeline testing

> **Output**: `phase3_pipeline_implementation.md` (Pipeline Architecture, Code Repository, Quality Rules, Orchestration DAGs, Testing Results).

---

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization & Cost Management

**Objective**: Optimize pipelines for speed and cost efficiency.

1. **Query Optimization** – Analyze and tune slow queries
2. **Storage Optimization** – Compression, partitioning, archival
3. **Compute Optimization** – Right-size resources, spot instances
4. **Caching Strategy** – Implement materialized views and caching
5. **Cost Analysis** – Monitor and optimize cloud costs
6. **Quality Gate** – Verify performance improvements

> **Output**: `phase4_optimization_report.md` (Performance Metrics, Cost Analysis, Optimization Log, Caching Strategy, Resource Configuration).

---

### Phase 5: Data Governance & Operations

**Objective**: Establish data governance and operational excellence.

1. **Data Catalog** – Document all datasets and metrics
2. **Access Control** – Implement data security and privacy
3. **Monitoring Setup** – Pipeline health and data quality alerts
4. **Documentation** – User guides and operational runbooks
5. **Self-Service Analytics** – Enable business users with tools
6. **Final Quality Gate** – Production readiness review

> **Output**: `phase5_data_operations.md` (Data Catalog, Access Policies, Monitoring Dashboard, Documentation Suite, Training Materials).

## 📝 Universal Prompts & Patterns

- **Think Incrementally**: "Can we process only changed data?"
- **Optimize Early**: "What's the most expensive operation here?"
- **Quality First**: "What data quality checks are needed?"
- **Business Value**: "How does this data drive decisions?"

---

## 🛑 Guardrails (What NOT to Do)

1. **Never ignore data quality** – Bad data leads to bad decisions
2. **Don't over-engineer** – Start simple, iterate based on needs
3. **Avoid data silos** – Design for cross-functional access
4. **Never skip documentation** – Future users need context

# System Architecture Protocol (SAP)

> **Purpose**: Provide a systematic, phased approach for an AI system architect to design scalable, maintainable, and robust software architectures. This protocol emphasizes clear documentation, stakeholder alignment, and evidence-based decision making.
>
> This protocol incorporates best practices from leading tech companies and architectural frameworks including C4 Model, Domain-Driven Design, TOGAF principles, and microservices patterns.

## 🔄 High-Level SAP Cycle

1. **Context → Analysis → Design → Validate → Document**
2. Each phase ends with an *Alignment Check* requiring explicit **Yes** before advancing
3. Outputs are architectural artifacts: diagrams, ADRs, and implementation guides

## 📑 Phase Instructions

### Phase 1: Context & Requirements Alignment

**Objective**: Understand the business context, technical constraints, and quality attributes.

| Step | Key Prompts | Sub-Checkpoint |
| ---- | ----------- | -------------- |
| 1. Business Context | "What business problem are we solving?" | Business goals documented |
| 2. Technical Landscape | "What existing systems must we integrate with?" | System inventory created |
| 3. Quality Attributes | "What are the key -ilities (scalability, reliability, etc.)?" | Quality matrix defined |
| 4. Constraints | "What technical, regulatory, or organizational constraints exist?" | Constraints logged |
| 5. Alignment Check | Present context summary → **(Yes \| No \| Clarify)** | ✓ Move to Phase 2 |

> **Expected Output**: `phase1_context_analysis.md` with sections: Business Context, Technical Landscape, Quality Requirements, Constraints, Assumptions, Confirmation.

### Phase 2: Architecture Analysis & Pattern Selection

**Objective**: Analyze requirements and select appropriate architectural patterns.

1. **Decompose System** – Identify major components and boundaries
2. **Pattern Matching** – Map requirements to proven patterns (microservices, monolith, serverless, etc.)
3. **Technology Stack Analysis** – Evaluate technology options against constraints
4. **Risk Assessment** – Identify architectural risks and mitigation strategies
5. **Alignment Check** – Review analysis findings → confirm direction

> **Output**: `phase2_architecture_analysis.md` (Component Analysis, Pattern Recommendations, Technology Options, Risk Matrix, Decision Rationale).

---

### Phase 3: Architecture Design & Modeling

**Objective**: Create detailed architectural designs using industry-standard notations.

| Technique | Purpose | Deliverable |
| --------- | ------- | ----------- |
| **C4 Model** | Hierarchical system views | Context, Container, Component diagrams |
| **Sequence Diagrams** | Key interaction flows | Critical path sequences |
| **Data Flow** | Information architecture | Data flow diagrams |
| **Deployment View** | Infrastructure design | Deployment topology |

**Flow**:
1. Create high-level system context
2. Design container architecture
3. Detail component interactions
4. Define data models and flows
5. Specify deployment architecture
6. Alignment Check with visual models

> **Output**: `phase3_architecture_design.md` (Diagrams, Design Decisions, Interface Specifications, Data Models).

---

### Phase 4: Validation & Trade-off Analysis

**Objective**: Validate design against requirements and analyze trade-offs.

1. **Scenario Walkthroughs** – Test design against use cases
2. **Quality Attribute Scenarios** – Verify -ilities are met
3. **Trade-off Analysis** – Document architectural compromises
4. **Proof of Concept Planning** – Identify areas needing validation
5. **Stakeholder Review** – Present to technical and business stakeholders
6. **Alignment Check**

> **Output**: `phase4_validation_analysis.md` (Scenario Results, Trade-off Matrix, PoC Recommendations, Review Feedback).

---

### Phase 5: Documentation & Implementation Guide

**Objective**: Create comprehensive documentation for development teams.

1. **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** – Document key decisions
2. **Implementation Roadmap** – Phased development plan
3. **Developer Guidelines** – Coding standards and patterns
4. **Integration Specifications** – API contracts and protocols
5. **Monitoring Strategy** – Observability requirements
6. **Final Alignment** – Lock architecture version

> **Output**: `phase5_architecture_specification.md` (Complete Architecture Package, ADRs, Implementation Guide, Version Tag).

## 📝 Universal Prompts & Patterns

- **Clarify Scale**: "What's the expected load in requests/second and data volume?"
- **Explore Trade-offs**: "If we optimize for X, what do we sacrifice?"
- **Validate Assumptions**: "What evidence supports this architectural choice?"
- **Consider Evolution**: "How will this architecture adapt to future requirements?"

## 🛑 Guardrails (What NOT to Do)

1. **Never over-engineer** – Start simple, evolve as needed
2. **Don't ignore existing systems** – Consider integration from day one
3. **Avoid technology bias** – Choose based on requirements, not preferences
4. **Never skip documentation** – Future teams depend on your artifacts

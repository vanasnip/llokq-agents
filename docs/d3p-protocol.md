# D3P Protocol Guide

The Dialogue-Driven Development Protocol (D3P) is a comprehensive methodology for AI-assisted software development that emphasizes structured communication and phased delivery.

## Phase Management

### Navigating Phases

```bash
# Check current phase
/phase --current

# View phase details
/phase --info 5

# Move to next phase
/phase --next

# Jump to specific phase
/phase --goto 7

# View phase requirements
/phase --requirements
```

### Phase Dependencies

Some phases have strict dependencies:

```
Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3
         ↘
           Phase 4 → Phase 5 → Phase 6 → Phase 7
                                      ↘
                                        Phase 8 → Phase 9 → Phase 10
```

### Phase Customization

Customize phases in `~/.claude/d3p-config.yml`:

```yaml
custom_phases:
  phase_5:
    additional_agents: ["ml_engineer"]
    custom_deliverables:
      - "ml-models/"
      - "training-data/"
    
  phase_6:
    skip_if: "project_type != 'enterprise'"
    
  phase_11:  # Add custom phase
    name: "Post-Launch Optimization"
    agents: ["performance", "data"]
    deliverables:
      - "optimization-report.md"
```

## D3P Best Practices

### 1. Phase Entry Criteria

Before entering a phase, ensure:
- Previous phase exit criteria met
- Required resources available
- Team alignment on goals
- Risk mitigation in place

### 2. Continuous Communication

- Daily standup within phases
- Phase transition meetings
- Stakeholder updates
- Risk communication

### 3. Iterative Refinement

D3P supports iteration:
- Return to previous phases when needed
- Refine deliverables based on feedback
- Adjust phase goals as project evolves

### 4. Quality Gates

Each phase has quality gates:
- Code quality metrics
- Test coverage requirements
- Performance benchmarks
- Security standards

## D3P Principles

### 1. Dialogue-Driven

All decisions emerge from structured dialogue:
- Agent-to-agent communication
- Human-agent collaboration
- Stakeholder feedback loops
- Continuous alignment

### 2. Incremental Delivery

Value delivered at each phase:
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- But documentation when needed
- Early and continuous delivery
- Feedback incorporation

### 3. Agent Specialization

Leverage agent expertise:
- Right agent for right task
- Collaborative problem solving
- Knowledge sharing
- Skill complementarity

### 4. Adaptive Planning

Plans evolve with understanding:
- Embrace changing requirements
- Learn from each phase
- Adjust based on feedback
- Maintain flexibility

## Common Patterns

### Fast Track Pattern

For MVP or proof-of-concept:
```
Phase 1 (compressed) → Phase 2 (minimal) → Phase 5 (core only) → Phase 9
```

### Enterprise Pattern

For large-scale projects:
```
All phases with extended Phase 6 (security) and Phase 8 (deployment)
```

### Maintenance Pattern

For existing systems:
```
Start at Phase 5 → Phase 6 → Phase 7 → Phase 10
```

## Phase Metrics

Track phase health:

```bash
# Phase metrics
/phase --metrics

# Time in phase
/phase --duration

# Phase velocity
/phase --velocity

# Deliverable completion
/phase --deliverables --status
```

### Key Metrics

- **Phase Duration**: Target vs actual
- **Deliverable Quality**: Review scores
- **Team Velocity**: Story points/features
- **Defect Density**: Bugs per phase
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: NPS scores

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Phase Skipping

❌ Don't skip phases to save time
✅ Do customize phases for your needs

### 2. Big Bang Integration

❌ Don't wait until Phase 9 to integrate
✅ Do continuous integration throughout

### 3. Documentation Deferral

❌ Don't leave all docs to Phase 10
✅ Do document as you go

### 4. Stakeholder Absence

❌ Don't exclude stakeholders until launch
✅ Do involve stakeholders throughout

## D3P Tools

### Phase Templates

```bash
# Generate phase checklist
/phase --checklist 5 > phase5-checklist.md

# Create phase report
/phase --report > phase-report.md

# Export phase plan
/phase --export 6 --format gantt
```

### Phase Automation

```python
# Automated phase transitions
from unified.d3p import PhaseManager

phase_manager = PhaseManager()

# Auto-advance when criteria met
phase_manager.set_auto_advance(True)
phase_manager.set_criteria({
    'test_coverage': 80,
    'bugs_remaining': 0,
    'approval': True
})
```

## Integration with Agile

D3P complements Agile methodologies:

### Scrum Integration
- Phases align with sprints
- Phase deliverables = sprint goals
- Daily standups within phases
- Retrospectives at phase end

### Kanban Integration
- Phase work items on board
- WIP limits per phase
- Continuous flow within phases
- Phase metrics on dashboard

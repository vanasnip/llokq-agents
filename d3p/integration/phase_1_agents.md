# D3P Phase 1: Vision & Intent Alignment - Agent Integration Guide

> This document details how agents collaborate during D3P Phase 1 to establish project vision and stakeholder alignment.

---

## Phase Overview

**Duration**: Typically 1-2 days  
**Goal**: Establish clear project vision, success criteria, and stakeholder alignment  
**Primary Agents**: `requirement_agent`, `system_architect`  
**Supporting Agents**: `aura_agent`, `brand_agent`, `api_architect`

---

## Agent Responsibilities

### Primary Agents

#### Requirement Agent (Riley)
**Role**: Lead facilitator for vision discovery  
**Activities**:
1. Conduct stakeholder interviews using 5 Whys technique
2. Elicit high-level goals and success metrics
3. Identify key constraints and assumptions
4. Document vision statement and objectives

**Key Prompts**:
- "What outcome are you hoping to achieve?"
- "What does success look like in 6 months?"
- "What are the must-have vs nice-to-have features?"
- "What constraints should we be aware of?"

**Outputs**:
- `vision_statement.md`
- `success_metrics.md`
- `constraints_assumptions.md`

#### System Architect (Archie)
**Role**: Technical vision and feasibility assessment  
**Activities**:
1. Assess technical feasibility of vision
2. Identify high-level architectural constraints
3. Propose technology stack options
4. Define quality attributes (scalability, reliability, etc.)

**Key Questions**:
- "What are the performance requirements?"
- "What systems need to integrate?"
- "What are the security/compliance needs?"
- "What's the expected scale and growth?"

**Outputs**:
- `technical_vision.md`
- `quality_attributes.md`
- `initial_constraints.md`

### Supporting Agents

#### Aura Agent
**Role**: Brand and experience vision alignment  
**Activities**:
- Ensure vision aligns with brand values
- Define desired user feeling and experience
- Contribute to success metrics from brand perspective

#### Brand Agent
**Role**: Visual and brand consistency  
**Activities**:
- Confirm brand guidelines applicability
- Identify any brand-specific requirements
- Flag potential brand conflicts early

#### API Architect (if applicable)
**Role**: API strategy alignment  
**Activities**:
- Identify if APIs are core to vision
- Propose API-first approach if relevant
- Define integration requirements

## Collaboration Workflow

### Step 1: Kickoff (All Agents)
**Time**: 30 minutes  
**Format**: Synchronous alignment
1. Review D3P Phase 1 objectives
2. Confirm agent roles and responsibilities
3. Establish communication channels
4. Set phase timeline

### Step 2: Discovery Sessions (Parallel)
**Time**: 2-4 hours  
**Format**: Parallel work streams

**Stream A - Business Vision** (Requirement Agent + Aura Agent)
- Stakeholder interviews
- Vision statement drafting
- Success criteria definition

**Stream B - Technical Vision** (System Architect + API Architect)
- Technical feasibility assessment
- Architecture constraints identification
- Technology options evaluation

### Step 3: Synthesis Meeting
**Time**: 1 hour  
**Format**: All agents synchronous
1. Requirement Agent presents business vision
2. System Architect presents technical vision
3. Identify gaps or conflicts
4. Align on unified vision

### Step 4: Documentation Sprint
**Time**: 2-3 hours  
**Format**: Parallel documentation
- Each agent completes their deliverables
- Cross-review for consistency
- Prepare for stakeholder review

### Step 5: Stakeholder Alignment
**Time**: 1 hour  
**Format**: Presentation and feedback
1. Present unified vision
2. Gather stakeholder feedback
3. Iterate if needed
4. Obtain formal approval

## Handoff Protocol

### Pre-handoff Checklist
- [ ] Vision statement approved by stakeholders
- [ ] Success metrics defined and measurable
- [ ] Technical constraints documented
- [ ] Quality attributes prioritized
- [ ] All agents agree on vision interpretation

### Handoff Package Contents
1. **Vision Portfolio**
   - Unified vision statement
   - Success metrics with targets
   - Stakeholder matrix with roles

2. **Technical Foundation**
   - High-level architecture vision
   - Technology stack recommendations
   - Key technical constraints

3. **Alignment Confirmation**
   - Signed-off meeting notes
   - Open questions log
   - Risk register (if any)

### Handoff to Phase 2
**Receiving Agents**: `requirement_agent` (continues), `layout_agent` (new)  
**Handoff Meeting**: 30 minutes
- Review Phase 1 outputs
- Clarify any questions
- Confirm Phase 2 readiness

---

## Quality Gates

### Required for Phase Completion
1. **Stakeholder Approval**: Formal sign-off on vision
2. **Technical Feasibility**: Architect confirms achievability
3. **Documentation Complete**: All outputs delivered
4. **Alignment Score**: >90% agreement among agents

### Red Flags Requiring Escalation
- Conflicting stakeholder visions
- Technical impossibilities identified
- Budget/timeline disconnect
- Missing key stakeholders

---

## Communication Templates

### Vision Statement Template
```markdown
## Project Vision

**Project Name**: [Name]
**Vision Statement**: In [timeframe], we will [achievement] for [target users] by [approach], resulting in [impact].

**Key Objectives**:
1. [Objective 1]
2. [Objective 2]
3. [Objective 3]

**Success Metrics**:
- [Metric 1]: [Current] → [Target]
- [Metric 2]: [Current] → [Target]
```

### Agent Coordination Format
```yaml
agent: requirement_agent
phase: 1
status: "Completed vision elicitation"
blockers: none
next_steps: "Review with architect"
outputs:
  - vision_statement_v1.md
  - stakeholder_interviews.md
```

---

## Tools and Resources

### Required MCP Servers
- **filesystem**: Document creation and version control
- **memory**: Store discovered patterns and decisions
- **sequential**: Manage phased discovery process

### Recommended Tools
- Miro/FigJam for collaborative vision mapping
- Markdown for all documentation
- Git for version control
- Slack/Teams for agent communication

---

## Success Criteria

Phase 1 is successful when:
1. All stakeholders agree on project vision
2. Success metrics are specific and measurable
3. Technical feasibility is confirmed
4. All agents understand their role in achieving vision
5. Clear handoff to Phase 2 is ready

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Rushing to Solution**: Stay in problem/vision space
2. **Vague Success Metrics**: Make them SMART
3. **Missing Stakeholders**: Include all decision makers
4. **Technical Assumptions**: Validate all assumptions
5. **Poor Documentation**: Future phases depend on clarity

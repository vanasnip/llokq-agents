# AI Agent Development System

> A comprehensive multi-agent system for software development, integrating design and development agents with the D3P (Dialogue-Driven Development Protocol) methodology.

## 🎯 Overview

This repository contains a complete AI agent ecosystem designed to handle all aspects of software development - from initial requirements gathering through deployment and maintenance. The system uses specialized AI agents that collaborate through structured workflows and the D3P protocol.

### Key Features

- **20+ Specialized Agents**: Each focused on specific domains (architecture, backend, frontend, QA, security, etc.)
- **D3P Integration**: Master orchestration protocol that guides project flow
- **Multi-Agent Workflows**: Pre-defined workflows for common development tasks
- **MCP Server Support**: Integrated with Multiple Context Protocol servers
- **Design + Dev Unity**: Seamless collaboration between design and development agents

## 🔄 D3P Protocol Integration

The D3P (Dialogue-Driven Development Protocol) serves as the master orchestrator for all agents. It defines 10 phases that guide a project from inception to completion:

1. **Vision & Intent Alignment** - Establish project goals
2. **User & Stakeholder Mapping** - Understand audiences
3. **Requirements Discovery** - Detailed requirements
4. **Design & Architecture** - System design
5. **Development Planning** - Sprint preparation
6. **Core Development** - Implementation
7. **Testing & Security** - Quality assurance
8. **Refinement** - Optimization
9. **Deployment** - Production release
10. **Documentation** - Knowledge transfer

Each phase activates specific agents based on the work required. See `d3p/agent_mapping.yaml` for detailed phase-to-agent mappings.

## 🎭 Multi-Agent Workflows

Pre-defined workflows for common development scenarios:

### Feature Development Workflow
Complete end-to-end feature implementation involving:
- Requirements → Architecture → Implementation → Testing → Deployment

### Bug Investigation Workflow
Systematic bug resolution process:
- Triage → Root Cause Analysis → Fix → Test → Deploy → Post-mortem

### Additional Workflows (Planned)
- Performance Optimization
- Security Audit
- API Development
- Database Migration
- Infrastructure Scaling

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Git
- Node.js/Python (depending on implementation)
- Access to MCP servers (filesystem, shell, memory, etc.)
- Development environment

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd agents
   ```

2. **Review agent configurations**
   ```bash
   # Design agents
   cat design_agents/agents.yaml
   
   # Development agents
   cat dev_agents/agents.yaml
   ```

3. **Understand D3P phases**
   ```bash
   # View D3P phase mappings
   cat d3p/agent_mapping.yaml
   ```

4. **Explore workflows**
   ```bash
   # Example: Feature development workflow
   cat orchestration/workflows/feature_development.yaml
   ```

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Starting a New Project

1. Begin with D3P Phase 1 (Vision Alignment)
2. Activate `requirement_agent` and `system_architect`
3. Follow the phase progression in `d3p/agent_mapping.yaml`

### Implementing a Feature

1. Use the Feature Development workflow
2. Start with requirements gathering
3. Progress through design, implementation, testing, and deployment
4. Each phase activates appropriate agents automatically

### Investigating a Bug

1. Trigger Bug Investigation workflow
2. QA engineer leads triage
3. Relevant engineers investigate based on bug type
4. Follow systematic resolution process

## 🔧 Configuration

### Agent Configuration
Each agent has:
- **Identity**: Role and personality
- **Core Belief**: Guiding principle
- **MCP Preferences**: Preferred tools and servers
- **Phase Protocol**: Specific workflow steps

### Workflow Configuration
Workflows define:
- **Phases**: Sequential or parallel execution
- **Agent Assignments**: Primary and supporting roles
- **Handoff Protocols**: How work transfers between agents
- **Success Criteria**: Validation requirements

## 📊 MCP Server Integration

Agents use various MCP (Multiple Context Protocol) servers:

- **filesystem**: Code and documentation management
- **shell**: Command execution and builds
- **memory**: State and pattern storage
- **sequential**: Ordered processing
- **playwright**: Testing and browser automation

## 🤝 Collaboration Patterns

### Sequential Collaboration
Agents work in sequence, each building on previous work.
Example: Architect → Backend → Frontend → QA

### Parallel Collaboration
Multiple agents work simultaneously.
Example: Backend + Frontend during implementation

### Consultative Collaboration
Supporting agents provide expertise as needed.
Example: Security engineer consulted throughout

## 📈 Best Practices

1. **Always Start with D3P Phase 1** - Ensure alignment before development
2. **Use Appropriate Workflows** - Don't reinvent, use predefined workflows
3. **Document Handoffs** - Clear communication between agents
4. **Validate at Gates** - Don't skip phase validation
5. **Maintain Traceability** - Keep clear audit trail

## 🔍 Monitoring & Metrics

### Process Metrics
- Time per phase
- Handoff efficiency
- Defect escape rate

### Outcome Metrics
- Feature delivery time
- Bug resolution time
- Code quality scores

## 🛠️ Extending the System

### Adding New Agents
1. Define agent in appropriate `agents.yaml`
2. Create phase protocol in `phases/`
3. Update D3P mappings
4. Add to relevant workflows

### Creating New Workflows
1. Identify common patterns
2. Define phases and agent assignments
3. Create workflow YAML in `orchestration/workflows/`
4. Document usage and variations

1. **Agent Handoff Failures**
   - Check output artifacts
   - Verify phase completion criteria
   - Review handoff protocols

2. **Workflow Bottlenecks**
   - Identify blocking agents
   - Check for missing prerequisites
   - Consider parallel execution

3. **D3P Phase Misalignment**

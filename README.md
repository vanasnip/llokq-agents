## 🤖 Available Agents

The system includes 15 specialized agents across 5 categories:

- **Design** (5): UI/UX, accessibility, branding, layout, requirements
- **Architecture** (2): System design, API design
- **Development** (4): Backend, frontend, data, mobile
- **Quality** (3): QA, security, performance
- **Operations** (1): DevOps and platform engineering

See the [Agent Catalog](docs/agents.md) for detailed information.

## 💻 Basic Usage

```bash
# List agents
unified-agents agents

# Get agent info
unified-agents info backend

# Start interactive mode
unified-agents interactive
```

In interactive mode:

```bash
# Execute with agents
/code --backend --frontend
/design --aura --layout_loom
/test --qa --security

# Run workflows
/workflow feature
/workflow bug
/workflow security
```

See [Command Reference](docs/commands.md) for all commands.

## 🛡️ Security Features

- **Sandboxed Execution** - Isolated environments for untrusted code
- **Input Validation** - Comprehensive validation framework
- **Command Filtering** - Whitelist-based command execution
- **Resource Limits** - Memory, CPU, and file size restrictions

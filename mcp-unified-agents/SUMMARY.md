# MCP Server MVP Summary

## What We Built

A lean Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for the Unified Agents system:

- **~400 lines of code** - Focused, minimal implementation
- **3 core agents** - QA, Backend, System Architect
- **5 tools** - Test generation, bug analysis, API design, code optimization, system design
- **YAML/JSON support** - Flexible configuration with fallback
- **Capability graph** - Shows relationships between agent capabilities

## Files Created

1. **server.py** - Main MCP server implementation
2. **agents.yaml** - YAML agent manifest (preferred)
3. **agents.json** - JSON fallback for environments without PyYAML
4. **test_server.py** - Standalone test script
5. **README.md** - Quick start guide
6. **requirements.txt** - Python dependencies (PyYAML)

## Key Features

### Agent Definition as Data
Agents are defined in manifest files, not code:
- Easy to modify without changing server code
- Clear separation of configuration and implementation
- Support for both YAML and JSON formats

### Capability Graph
Shows relationships between capabilities:
- **Requires**: Prerequisites for a capability
- **Provides**: What a capability enables
- **Complements**: What works well together

### Simple Tool Implementation
Each tool has:
- Clear input schema with validation
- Focused, practical output
- Agent personality reflected in responses

## Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:
```bash
python test_server.py
```

## Integration with Claude Code

Add to `~/.claude/claude_code_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unified-agents": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/path/to/mcp-unified-agents/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

This MVP provides a solid foundation for:
1. Adding more agents (up to 15 total)
2. Implementing agent discovery tools
3. Adding user control mechanisms
4. Creating multi-agent workflows
5. Building a full MCP ecosystem

The lean approach allows for validated learning before expanding functionality.

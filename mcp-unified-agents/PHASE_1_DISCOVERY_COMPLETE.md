# Phase 1.1 Complete: Agent Discovery Tools

## Implemented Discovery Tools

### 1. `ua_agents_list`
Lists all available agents with:
- Agent name and ID
- Description
- Personality traits
- Capabilities
- Available tools

### 2. `ua_agent_info`
Provides detailed information about a specific agent:
- Full agent profile
- Capability relationships from graph
- Detailed tool documentation with parameters
- Works well with relationships

### 3. `ua_capability_search`
Smart search for agents by capability or domain:
- Searches in agent names, descriptions, capabilities, and tools
- Scoring system for relevance
- Returns ranked results with match reasons

### 4. `ua_agent_compatible`
Finds agents that work well together:
- Uses capability graph relationships
- Shows complementary capabilities
- Helps build effective multi-agent teams

## Key Features

1. **No External Dependencies**: Uses only Python standard library
2. **Rich Formatting**: Returns well-formatted markdown for Claude
3. **Smart Matching**: Fuzzy search with relevance scoring
4. **Graph Integration**: Leverages capability graph for relationships

## Test Results

All discovery tools tested and working:
- ✅ Tools appear in tools/list
- ✅ Agent listing shows all 3 agents
- ✅ Agent info provides detailed profiles
- ✅ Capability search finds relevant agents
- ✅ Compatibility finder shows relationships

## Example Usage in Claude Code

```
User: "What agents can help with API development?"

Claude: Let me search for agents with API capabilities...
[Calls ua_capability_search with query="api"]

I found that the Backend Agent is best suited for API development, with:
- API design capability
- REST API design tool
- Experience with backend implementation

Would you like me to use the Backend Agent to help design your API?
```

## Next: Phase 1.2 - User Control

The next step is implementing user control mechanisms:
- `ua_suggest_agents` - Claude suggests agents for tasks
- `ua_approve_agents` - User approves/rejects suggestions
- `ua_set_preferences` - Session-wide preferences

This will enable the approval flow where users maintain control over which agents are activated.

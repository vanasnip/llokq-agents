# MCP Server Review Fixes Summary

## ✅ STATUS: ALL REVIEW FIXES COMPLETED

## Changes Implemented

### ✅ 1. Added JSON Schema Validation (Blocker - Fixed)
- Added `validate_manifest()` function with comprehensive validation
- Validates structure, required fields, and tool naming patterns
- Provides clear error messages with specific field/agent context
- Fails fast on invalid manifests preventing runtime crashes

### ✅ 2. Fixed Error Handling with Proper JSON-RPC Codes (Blocker - Fixed)
- Updated `_error_response()` to accept error codes
- Implemented standard JSON-RPC error codes:
  - `-32700`: Parse error (invalid JSON)
  - `-32601`: Method not found (unknown method/tool)
  - `-32602`: Invalid params (missing required parameters)
  - `-32603`: Internal error (default for unexpected errors)
- Added proper exception handling in tool handlers
- Tool routing now catches and properly reports errors

### ✅ 3. Added Concurrency Documentation (Quick Fix - Done)
- Added clear header comment explaining serial processing is intentional
- Includes TODO for future asyncio implementation if needed
- Sets proper expectations for MVP scope

### ✅ 4. Removed YAML Redundancy (Done)
- Deleted `agents.yaml` file
- Removed PyYAML import and fallback code
- Updated default manifest path to `agents.json`
- Removed `requirements.txt` (no external dependencies needed)
- Simplified `_load_agents()` and `_load_capability_graph()` methods

### ✅ 5. Updated README with Troubleshooting (Done)
- Added comprehensive troubleshooting section with solutions
- Included manual testing examples with JSON-RPC
- Added common issues table
- Documented how to add new agents
- Clarified no dependencies required

## What We Didn't Implement (and Why)

### ❌ Security Guardrails
- Not needed - MCP agents generate text suggestions, don't execute code
- DiscourseAgent guardrails are for a different use case

### ❌ Asyncio Support
- Serial processing is fine for MVP
- Keeps implementation simple (~400 lines)
- Can be added later if needed

### ❌ Module Splitting
- Current file is manageable and readable
- Premature optimization for MVP

### ❌ Comprehensive Test Suite
- Happy path testing via test_server.py is sufficient for MVP
- Can expand testing in Phase 2

## Test Results

All tests pass successfully after changes:
- Server starts without errors
- Schema validation works
- Error codes returned properly
- JSON-only loading works
- No external dependencies required

## Lines of Code

- `server.py`: ~590 lines (includes validation and error handling)
- Still within reasonable bounds for single-file MVP
- Well-organized with clear sections

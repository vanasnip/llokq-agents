# D3P Agents Documentation

## Overview

The D3P (Dialogue-Driven Development Protocol) is a comprehensive 10-phase software development methodology that emphasizes structured dialogue between AI agents and humans. This document outlines the D3P framework, its specialized agents, and provides detailed implementation guidance for integrating these agents into the MCP unified agents system.

## The D3P Framework

### Core Principles

1. **Dialogue-Driven**: All decisions emerge from structured dialogue
2. **Phased Delivery**: 10 distinct phases with clear entry/exit criteria
3. **Agent Specialization**: Each agent has specific expertise and responsibilities
4. **Collaborative Intelligence**: Agents work together, complementing each other's capabilities

### The 10 D3P Phases

1. **Vision & Intent Alignment** - Establish project vision and goals
2. **User & Stakeholder Mapping** - Identify all users and stakeholders
3. **Requirements Discovery & Validation** - Detailed requirements gathering
4. **Design & Architecture Planning** - System and UI/UX design
5. **Development Sprint Planning** - Prepare for implementation
6. **Core Development & Integration** - Build core features
7. **Quality Assurance & Security** - Testing and security validation
8. **Refinement & Optimization** - Performance and UX optimization
9. **Deployment & Release** - Production deployment
10. **Documentation & Knowledge Transfer** - Comprehensive documentation

## D3P Design Agents

### 1. Discourse Agent (Dialogue/Conversation Facilitator)

#### Overview
The Discourse Agent is a unique "Conversational Facilitator & Knowledge Architect" that serves as the philosophical heart of the D3P methodology.

#### Identity & Philosophy
- **Identity**: Conversational Facilitator & Knowledge Architect
- **Core Belief**: "Understanding emerges through structured dialogue"
- **Primary Question**: "What insights should we preserve from this discussion?"
- **Decision Framework**: capture > execute | clarity > action | memory > immediacy

#### Key Characteristics
- **Risk Profile**: Zero tolerance (100% read-only operations)
- **Communication Style**: Socratic, reflective, structured
- **Problem Solving**: Explore > Synthesize > Archive > Reference

#### Capabilities
1. **Conversation Management**
   - Manages conversation phases (Exploration → Analysis → Synthesis → Decision → Archive)
   - Tracks different entry types (Questions, Insights, Decisions, Summaries)
   - Organizes knowledge by categories and topics

2. **Knowledge Architecture**
   - Extracts and preserves insights from discussions
   - Creates structured summaries and outlines
   - Maintains conversation memory and context

3. **Facilitation Tools**
   - `discuss`: Facilitate a discussion on a topic
   - `question`: Add questions to explore
   - `insight`: Record insights or observations
   - `decide`: Make and record decisions
   - `summarize`: Generate conversation summary
   - `archive`: Prepare discussion for archival
   - `memory`: Manage conversation memory
   - `phase`: Transition conversation phase
   - `search`: Search conversation entries
   - `outline`: Generate conversation outline
   - `context`: Get current conversation context

#### Implementation Details
- **Read-Only Constraint**: All operations are strictly read-only
- **Delegation**: Can delegate to other agents with read-only constraints
- **Archive System**: Stores conversations in structured JSON and Markdown formats
- **Memory Categories**: Organizes entries by type, phase, and custom categories

## Integration Plan for Adding Discourse Agent to MCP

### Step 1: Update agents.json
Add the Discourse Agent definition:

```json
"discourse": {
  "name": "Discourse Agent",
  "description": "Conversational Facilitator & Knowledge Architect - facilitates structured dialogue and preserves insights",
  "personality": "Socratic, reflective, structured",
  "capabilities": ["conversation_facilitation", "knowledge_extraction", "decision_documentation"],
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "ua_discourse_discuss",
      "description": "Facilitate a discussion on a topic",
      "parameters": {
        "topic": {"type": "string", "description": "Topic to discuss"},
        "context?": {"type": "object", "description": "Additional context"}
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "ua_discourse_question",
      "description": "Add a question to explore",
      "parameters": {
        "question": {"type": "string", "description": "Question to explore"},
        "category?": {"type": "string", "description": "Question category"}
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "ua_discourse_insight",
      "description": "Record an insight or observation",
      "parameters": {
        "insight": {"type": "string", "description": "Insight to record"},
        "references?": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "ua_discourse_decide",
      "description": "Make and record a decision",
      "parameters": {
        "decision": {"type": "string", "description": "Decision made"},
        "context?": {"type": "object", "description": "Decision context"}
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "ua_discourse_summarize",
      "description": "Generate conversation summary",
      "parameters": {
        "depth?": {"type": "string", "enum": ["brief", "detailed"], "description": "Summary depth"}
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Implement Handler Methods in server.py
Add discourse tool handlers:

```python
def _handle_discourse_tool(self, tool_name: str, args: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Handle Discourse agent tools"""
    try:
        if tool_name == 'ua_discourse_discuss':
            return self._discourse_discuss(args['topic'], args.get('context', {}))
        elif tool_name == 'ua_discourse_question':
            return self._discourse_question(args['question'], args.get('category'))
        elif tool_name == 'ua_discourse_insight':
            return self._discourse_insight(args['insight'], args.get('references', []))
        elif tool_name == 'ua_discourse_decide':
            return self._discourse_decide(args['decision'], args.get('context', {}))
        elif tool_name == 'ua_discourse_summarize':
            return self._discourse_summarize(args.get('depth', 'brief'))
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown Discourse tool: {tool_name}")
    except KeyError as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Missing required parameter: {e}")
```

### Step 3: Add Conversation State Management
Implement a simplified conversation manager:

```python
class ConversationState:
    """Manages discourse conversation state"""
    def __init__(self):
        self.entries = []
        self.phase = "exploration"
        self.decisions = []
        self.insights = []
        self.questions = []
```

### Step 4: Update Capability Graph
Add discourse-related capabilities:

```json
"conversation_facilitation": {
  "provides": ["structured_dialogue", "knowledge_capture"],
  "complements": ["requirements_discovery", "system_design", "test_generation"]
},
"knowledge_extraction": {
  "requires": ["conversation_facilitation"],
  "provides": ["documentation", "decision_records"],
  "complements": ["api_documentation", "user_guides"]
}
```

4. **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to add new agents as needed
5. **Clear Responsibilities**: Each agent has well-defined boundaries
6. **Knowledge Preservation**: Discourse Agent ensures insights are captured

## Conclusion

The D3P framework provides a rich set of specialized agents that can significantly enhance the MCP unified agents system. Starting with the Discourse Agent as the next addition makes sense because:

1. It embodies the core D3P philosophy of dialogue-driven development
2. It's read-only, making it safe to implement and test
3. It provides immediate value by organizing and preserving knowledge
4. It complements existing agents by facilitating their collaboration

The modular architecture of the MCP unified agents system makes it straightforward to add these new agents incrementally, allowing for thorough testing and refinement of each agent before moving to the next.
